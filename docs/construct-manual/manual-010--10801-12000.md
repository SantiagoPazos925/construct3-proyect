HTML LAYERS
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/tips-and-guides/html-layers

Construct supports integrating HTML content with your project. This includes the HTML Element
object, as well as other plugins in the HTML elements category, such as Button and Text Input.
Layering HTML objects works differently to other kinds of objects. In particular, to have other
Construct objects appear on top of HTML objects, it is necessary to use HTML layers. This guide
explains how HTML layers work.
Using HTML layers is useful for better integration of HTML content in your project. For example
if you want to use HTML for part of your project's user interface, but then have some decoration
like a Particle effect appear on top of the user interface, then it is necessary to use HTML layers
to get the Particle effect to appear on top of the HTML content.

Canvas vs. HTML objects
Most Construct objects, such as Sprite, Tiled Background and Particles, render in to a <canvas>
element. These kinds of objects are collectively referred to as canvas objects. The canvas
element is a single HTML element that effectively acts as a large image that changes every
frame. Much like the usual <img> (image) element, it can only be placed entirely in front or
behind other HTML elements - there is no way for it to appear both partly in front and partly
behind another HTML element.
HTML objects like Button and Text Input are themselves represented by other HTML elements
( <button> and <input> respectively). These kinds of objects are collectively referred to as
HTML objects. They are not drawn in to the canvas. Therefore they can only appear in front of, or
behind, a canvas element.
By default Construct creates a single canvas element, and all other HTML elements are placed
on top of the canvas. For example if a project uses a Sprite and a Button object, Construct will
use the following stack of HTML elements (in top-to-bottom order):
<button>

for the Button object (on top)

<canvas>

for canvas objects like Sprite (underneath)

With this arrangement, it is not possible for the Sprite object to appear on top of the Button
object, even if the Sprite is on a layer above the Button object, or if it is on top in Z order on the
same layer. In other words, the HTML layering takes precedence over Construct's Z order.

HTML layers
It is possible to have canvas objects render on top of HTML objects by making use of
Construct's HTML layers feature. Checking the HTML elements layer property of a layer will turn

Page 349 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

that layer in to a HTML layer, and indicate this status in the Layers Bar with a special tag icon.
Then content on other layers above it will appear on top of HTML objects on that layer.
This works by creating an additional <canvas> element per HTML layer. For example consider
the following arrangement of layers:
Layer 1 with a Sprite object
Layer 0 with a Button object
Normally, the Button will appear on top of the Sprite object even though it is layered beneath it,
due to the reason described above. However if Layer 0 is made a HTML layer, it is now possible
for the Sprite to appear on top of the Button. This is because Construct now creates the
following HTML elements (in top-to-bottom order):
<canvas>

for Layer 1, with a Sprite object

<button>

for the Button object

<canvas>

for Layer 0, with any other canvas objects

Note that HTML objects still appear on top of any other canvas objects on the same layer.
However canvas objects on all layers above a HTML layer can then appear on top of the HTML
objects.
If multiple HTML objects are on the same HTML layer, then they are ordered in between the two
canvas elements, respecting their own relative Z order. In actual fact Construct uses a <div>
element wrapper to contain all HTML content in between canvases. This also ensures HTML
content is clipped to the canvas area, so they cut off when moving to the edge of the screen like
canvas objects.

The implicit top HTML layer
The top layer is always implicitly a HTML layer. In other words, if you have no HTML layers, then
HTML objects appear on top of all canvas objects, as all HTML elements are placed on top of
the <canvas> element by default, as illustrated in the first example in this guide.

Multiple layers
HTML objects on non-HTML layers will visually appear on the next HTML layer above them in Z
order. To illustrate this, consider this arrangement of layers.
Layer 7 (normal layer)
Layer 6 (normal layer)
Layer 5 (HTML layer)
Layer 4 (normal layer)
Layer 3 (normal layer)

Page 350 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Layer 2 (HTML layer)
Layer 1 (normal layer)
Layer 0 (normal layer)
This arrangement uses two HTML layers on Layer 2 and Layer 5. In this case, all HTML objects
on Layer 0, Layer 1 and Layer 2 will appear on Layer 2 (above all other canvas objects on layer 2);
all HTML objects on Layer 3, Layer 4 and Layer 5 will appear on Layer 5; and all HTML objects on
Layer 6 and Layer 7 will appear on top of those, as there is an implicit HTML layer at the top. This
is because Construct creates the following HTML elements (in top-to-bottom order):
HTML elements for layers 6-7
<canvas>

for canvas objects on layers 6-7

HTML elements for layers 3-5
<canvas>

for canvas objects on layers 3-5

HTML elements for layers 0-2
<canvas>

for canvas objects on layers 0-2

In this case, layers 0-2, layers 3-5, and layers 6-7 can each be thought of as separate HTML
layers. So in this case there are three HTML layers, as there are three options for where HTML
objects can appear relative to canvas objects, whereas there are eight canvas layers as there are
eight options for where canvas objects can appear (which are distributed across three canvas
elements).
Note that HTML objects always appear on top of all canvas objects on the same HTML layer. A
HTML layer can be thought of as a canvas element with all canvas objects paired with a layer of
HTML objects above it. Within a HTML layer, HTML objects will respect their relative Z order. For
example if a Button is layered on top of a Text Input in the same HTML layer, then Construct will
ensure the Button object's HTML element is layered on top of the Text Input's HTML element.
Only top-level layers can be made HTML layers. With this method of stacking canvas elements
and other HTML elements, it is not possible to support making sub-layers HTML layers.

Effects
When using effects, note they can only process content on the same canvas. This usually
affects background-blending effects. Taking the previous example of multiple layers, if there was
a background-blending effect on layer 5, then it will only be able to blend with content on layers
3-5. Layers below that are on a different HTML layer and so render to a different canvas, and
thus the background blending effect is not able to process them. This is a side-effect of the way
the rendering composition works: as each canvas is rendered separately, it is not possible for
effects to work across them.

Performance overhead
Page 351 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

As illustrated, for each layer which you make a HTML layer, an additional canvas element is
created at the size of the viewport. This comes with a performance overhead. It will impact two
aspects of performance:
1

Each canvas must be copied to the display every frame. This has the effect of drawing a
viewport-sized surface, much like a Force own texture layer. This uses up the GPU fill rate (see
Performance Tips for more details about fill rate). In some cases the compositing process may
require more than one copy, making it potentially two or three times as costly as a Force own
texture layer.

2

Each canvas must be allocated in memory, which will use at least as much memory as a
viewport-sized image. For example a 1920x1080 size canvas will require at least 8 MB of
memory (see Memory usage for more details). In some cases the compositing process may
require more than one surface, making it potentially use two or three times as much memory.

For this reason, avoid using too many HTML layers. Try to use the minimum necessary number
of HTML layers to achieve the layering you need for your project.

Positioning
HTML objects use a size and position based on the Construct layer they are on. In other words
they match the size and position that they would have if they were a canvas object. Therefore if
HTML objects are on layers with different scroll positions, scales, or parallax, they will match the
position of the layer they are on, even though they are displayed on the next HTML layer above
them.
Browsers do not always update canvas elements and other HTML elements at the same time.
You may find that if you move both canvas objects and HTML objects simultaneously at high
speed then a visible difference appears between them as one lags behind the other by a frame or
two, due to the browser drawing them at different times.

Dynamic layers
It's possible to dynamically add or change HTML layers using the Set layer HTML action or
isHTMLElementsLayer script property. This will cause Construct to add or remove canvas
elements, and rearrange the layering of HTML elements, to reflect the changes. However this is
complicated to synchronize, especially in worker mode where changes cannot be made
synchronously. This may result in a brief flicker as HTML changes are made. This may be able to
be avoided by ensuring sufficient HTML layers are created in advance of filling them with
content, or using techniques such as fading in content so it initially starts invisible and so a
flicker is not noticable.

INSTALLING THIRD-PARTY ADDONS
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/tips-and-guides/installing-thirdparty-addons

Third party developers can extend Construct 3 with new plugins, behaviors, effects and themes
(collectively referred to as "addons") using the Addon SDK. Addons are typically distributed as a
.c3addon file.
Only install addons from trustworthy developers who actively support their addons.
Malicious addons have the potential to compromise the security of your project, your
Construct account, or have hidden unwanted features like surprise adverts or tracking users.
Badly written addons can also cause bugs or glitches in your game, including corrupting
your project. While addons can be useful, remain vigilant about them, especially in regards
to whether the developer seems trustworthy and if they are still available and actively
supporting their addon to provide support and fix any problems that arise.
If you have problems with third-party addons, you must report the issues to the developer who
provided them. Scirra cannot offer any support for third party addons whatsoever.

Finding addons
You can visit the Addons section of the website to find plugins, behaviors, effects and themes
created by third-party developers. When you download an addon, you'll receive a .c3addon file,
which you can then install via the Addon Manager.

Installing an addon
To install an addon from a .c3addon file, first select Menu►View►Addon manager to open the
Addon Manager. In this dialog, click Install new addon... and choose the .c3addon file. Construct
3 will prompt to confirm installation of the addon. If you confirm the install, you must restart
Construct 3 before the addon is available. In the browser you can just press the Reload button.
Modern addons (using SDK v2) can also be installed by directly dragging and dropping the
.c3addon file in to Construct. Note however this is unavailable for legacy addons (using SDK v1).

Updating addons
By default Construct will check if any updates are available for installed addons via the Addons
website. If updates are available, it will show a notification on startup. Addons can then be
updated via the Addon Manager.

Page 353 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Addons installed from other sources rather than the Construct Addons website will not show
update prompts.

Uninstalling an addon
Third-party addons are listed at the top of the Addon Manager. Locate the addon, right-click on it
(or tap-and-hold), and select the Uninstall option. You can uncheck Show built-in addons or use
the search field to help you locate an addon.

Bundling addons to projects
Paid plans only Enable the Bundle addons project property to include any third-party addons the
project uses in the saved project file. This allows you to open the project on another device
without having to have the same third-party addons pre-installed, since the addons will be
loaded directly from the project file.
Sometimes you'll need to update a bundled addon to the latest version, if you update the
installed addon in Construct. To update a bundled addon, open the View used addons dialog by
right-clicking the project name in the Project Bar and selecting Tools►View used addons. In this
dialog you can right-click a bundled addon (highlighted in bold) and select Update to editor
version.

MIME TYPES
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/tips-and-guides/mime-types

When publishing to the web, it is important the server sends certain types of file with the correct
MIME type. For example, most servers are correctly set up to send a .html file with the MIME
type text/html. However some server's defaults don't include every MIME type your project
might need to use. Also some servers may be configured to send the wrong MIME type, which
may still cause some features to work incorrectly. The list below should be used as a reference
of the correct MIME types to have set.
Configuring your server's MIME types depends on your host. If you don't know how to do this,
contact your host for support, or ask them to set up the list below for you.
Having the wrong MIME type set can result in problems like the browser refusing to load the file;
the file returning "404 Not Found"; or causing the server to send a corrupt file (e.g. incorrectly
sending an audio file as a text file). This can result in issues like audio playback not working,
AJAX requests failing, or the project failing to start up.

MIME types for Construct projects
A server hosting an exported Construct project should have these file extensions associated
with these MIME types.

Offline caching

Page 355 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

If you find there is a problem with your MIME types after exporting and then fix them, the
problem may not appear to be immediately corrected if the browser has cached the previous
server responses for offline support.
The easiest way to verify the problem is fixed after correcting a server's MIME types is to change
the URL of the project, e.g. renaming the folder it was in on the server. This prevents the previous
offline cache being used to load the game and it will start fresh with the new MIME type
configuration taking effect.

types.

CONSTRUCT RELEASE CHANNELS
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/tips-and-guides/release-channels

You can find every release of Construct, past and present, on the releases page. Construct
releases are split in to three types of releases, called release channels: beta, stable and LTS
(Long Term Support). Broadly speaking, beta releases are the most frequent releases but most
likely to have unexpected issues, and LTS releases the most infrequent releases and least likely
to have unexpected issues. This guide briefly describes the differences between them and why
you might want to choose each.

Beta releases
Released about once a week, beta releases are mainly for testing purposes. Beta releases
haven't had as much testing as other releases, so unexpected problems are more likely to come
up. Be prepared for occasional disruption. You should probably not publish a finished project
from a beta release. However these releases get the latest bug fixes, new features and other
improvements the soonest. You may want to try a beta release to verify that a bug fix works
correctly for your project. People who want the latest features can use beta releases to try out
the latest improvements. Enthusiasts, or anyone else who wants to shape the development of
Construct, may also be interested in using beta releases and providing feedback to help us make
Construct in to what you want and need it to be - beta releases are where the main active
development of Construct takes place.
Occasionally very serious bugs may warrant a patch release of a beta release (i.e. a .2 release
the same week), but in general you should assume any issues will only be fixed in the following
week's beta release at the earliest.
You can load the latest beta release by visiting: editor.construct.net/beta

Stable releases
Released every 2-3 months, stable releases are the culmination of previous work on beta
releases. Once a suitable batch of work has been completed and any significant known issues
are identified and resolved, a new stable release is published including all the changes from the
past beta releases since the previous stable release. By this point all the changes are much more
likely to be reliable and bug-free. However sometimes mistakes happen and new issues appear.
Any major issues will likely be fixed in follow-up patch releases (i.e. a .2 or .3 release). Other
issues may be dealt with in subsequent beta releases and so only reach the next stable release.
Most people use stable releases - when you visit editor.construct.net in the address bar, it will
load the most recent stable release.
The time in between stable releases is called a release cycle. Usually the few beta releases prior
to a stable release stop introducing new features and instead focus solely on bug fixes and
Page 357 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

reliability to ensure the next stable release goes smoothly.

LTS releases
LTS stands for Long Term Support. These are released every year in the summer (in the northern
hemisphere, so around June or July), based off the latest stable release at that time, and are
supported with essential bug fixes and maintenance updates only for a period of 18 months (so
until the end of the following year). The aim is to have as few changes as possible to ensure a
consistent platform for purposes like testing and launching a major new project, or in education
to minimize any potentially disruptive changes during the academic year.
Most people should use stable releases over LTS releases. You should only choose an LTS
release where the importance of predictability outweighs the importance of bug fixes and the
latest new features. Software development is complex, and sometimes new bugs can
accidentally make their way to new stable releases. It's even possible a project depends on a bug
to work correctly, and fixing the bug causes the project to stop working; in a large project, fixing
such issues can sometimes be hard work. Sometimes changes which affect compatibility are
intentionally made for the long-term benefit of Construct. Suppose you are preparing to launch a
game that has been in development for a few years - in this case the last thing you want is some
new bug or compatibility difference to break your game just before launch. This is a good
situation to choose an LTS release: as you approach launch and start to focus on testing your
game, you may want to switch to an LTS release to minimize any unexpected changes to
Construct.
The downside of using an LTS release is that you won't get access to the latest new features and
updates, nor will you necessarily get the latest bug fixes either. If you are wondering if any
particular fix or change will be applied to an LTS release, the default answer is "no". Every change
brings a risk of breakage - as noted even bug fixes can cause breakages - and in order to provide
a consistent platform, LTS releases will change as little as possible. In general only fixes which
are absolutely critical will be applied to LTS releases. Generally this involves a new requirement
makes it impossible to publish projects any more unless something is changed. For example if
mobile publishing requirements are updated and a change must be made to continue publishing
mobile apps, or if a browser bug or compatibility change meant existing projects were broken,
that would warrant an update to an LTS release. In virtually all other cases, the change will only
be made for the latest beta release and be rolled out to everyone at the following stable release.
Even where LTS updates are made, they may only be some time after the change is made to
other release channels, in order to verify that the change works as expected.
If you use LTS releases, there is a chance you run in to some bug that is only fixed in the latest
stable release and does not meet the high bar to be applied to the LTS channel. In this case you
will have to update to the latest stable release. Therefore whether to use an LTS release, and
when to start using it, depends on your judgement of the trade-off between regular maintenance
and a predictable platform to publish with.
If you use an LTS release for more than a year, you may wish to consider switching to the LTS
release that comes out the following year. This choice depends on how far through your project
you are: if publishing is still some way off, it is probably a good idea to update and deal with any

Page 358 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

compatibility differences; if your project has already been published and you are just maintaining
it and don't think you'll need many more updates, then you may want to just stick with the same
LTS release.
You can load the latest LTS release by visiting: editor.construct.net/lts

Release numbering
Construct's release numbering scheme merely increments the release number for every beta
release, and is prefixed with an "r" for "release". For example a beta r400 will be followed by
another beta r401 about a week later. Every 2-3 months, a new stable release is made continuing
the incrementing release numbers. Occasionally "patch" releases are made to apply changes to
an existing release. These increment a number after a dot - e.g. r407.2 is a patch release for the
original r407 release.
In the summer the latest stable release is "promoted" to a new LTS release. As LTS releases are
supported for longer, they will tend to get more patch releases, such as r397.2, r397.3, and so on.

The life of a change
Suppose a change is made to Construct, such as a bug fix. Normally such a change will work its
way through the release channels as follows.
1

If the change is for a critical issue, it may be released as a patch release for beta, stable or LTS
releases. (Note the LTS release may be updated some time after other channels to verify the
change works as expected.)

2

Otherwise the change will first appear in the following weeks' beta release.

3

Within a couple of months, the next stable release will be published including the change.

4

Next summer, the current stable stable release will be promoted to LTS, including the change.

The release channel you choose depends on the trade-off you want between the latest bug fixes
and new features, and the chance that unexpected problems could cause disruption to your
project.

SUPERSEDED FEATURES
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/tips-and-guides/supersededfeatures

Construct has been in development for many years. Over time new features are occasionally
introduced that supersede older features and essentially make them redundant. Sometimes in
this case the older features are phased out and ultimately removed from Construct. For this
case, see Deprecated features. However in some cases these features are left in Construct
indefinitely for backwards compatibility reasons. For example the newer feature may not have
exactly the same capabilities as the older feature and so cannot fully replace it in every possible
usage scenario. Alternatively the older feature may have been around for such a long time that
removing it would require updating vast amounts of documentation, including printed books,
third-party tutorials, lesson plans used in educational institutions, and so on, which is on the
whole infeasible and so it's better to leave the older feature in.
Where older superseded features are left in, it's perfectly acceptable for existing projects, guides
and so on to keep using them. However new projects should avoid using them in favor of the
newer feature that supersedes them. Further, usually the older feature will not be supported to
the same extent as the newer feature, such as fixing possible issues or adding new requested
features, as we would instead recommend using the feature that supersedes it. In order to help
Construct users know which features to prefer and avoid, this guide lists the features we
consider superseded.

Pin behavior
The Pin behavior was widely used for many years, but it is almost completely superseded by the
Hierarchies feature. The 'Add child' hierarchy action is similar to pinning the child on to the
parent, but works more reliably when chains of objects are connected. Hierarchies can also be
set up in the Layout View.

Fade behavior
The Fade behavior was widely used for many years, but is superseded by the Tween behavior.
The Fade behavior essentially runs a pre-defined series of opacity tweens, which is now better
done in a more general way with the Tween behavior.

NW.js file pickers
The NW.js plugin has features that allow reading and writing files and folders from pickers. This
aspect of file system access has been superseded by the File System plugin which can work in
browsers and other platforms like Windows WebView2, so should be preferred over the NW.js
plugin features where possible. However the permissions model and use of file paths in the
NW.js plugin differs from the permissions model and paths used by the File System plugin, and
so the older NW.js plugin features are left in mainly for backwards compatibility.

Greenworks
Although not built-in to Construct, the Greenworks plugin for Steam support has now been
superseded by the Steamworks plugin for use with the Windows WebView2, macOS
WKWebView and Linux CEF export options.

Deprecated features
See also the section on Deprecated features, which covers features that will be completely
removed in future.

DEPRECATED FEATURES
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/tips-and-guides/deprecatedfeatures

Construct has been in development for many years. Much like with superseded features, over
time new features are occasionally introduced that replace older features. Usually the older
features are supported as long as possible to improve backwards compatibility. However
sometimes the maintenance burden and additional complications caused by having to continue
to have the older features means that they must ultimately be completely removed.
When you open a project, Construct will warn you of the upcoming removal of any deprecated
features the project uses, or possibly that the project uses a feature that was already removed.
The Deprecated features dialog may appear when opening a project to list all such features. It is
strongly recommended to act as soon as possible to resolve all the items listed, thereby
removing the use of all the deprecated features from your project. This will ensure your project
continues to be supported and work correctly in future. If you don't take action, you may find
your project stops working, or possibly cannot be opened, in a future release of Construct.
You can view the deprecated feature list for a project at any time, including if you previously
checked Don't show again for this project in the dialog, by right-clicking the project name in the
Project Bar and selecting Tools►View deprecated features. If the option does not appear, it
means the project does not use any deprecated features.
This guide covers every type of deprecation warning and describes steps to take to stop using
the deprecated feature.

Legacy SDK v1 plugins/behaviors
The industry-standard approach for addon systems is to use encapsulation to limit what addons
can do to known safe features only, which ensures they continue to work in the long-term.
Historically, partly due to past limitations of the JavaScript programming language, Construct
did not use encapsulation in its addon system. This meant addons could use unsafe features
that they were not meant to. This old system is referred to as SDK (Software Development Kit)
v1. The proliferation of addons using unsafe features has ended up breaking a lot of user's
projects; further, many SDK v1 addons that currently appear to work are also at risk of suddenly
breaking at any time in the future.
To fix this Construct is moving its addon system to an industry-standard approach with
encapsulation. The new system is referred to as SDK v2. This should guarantee that addons are
permanently supported and safe to use in the long-term with virtually no risk of breaking your
project. However plugins and behaviors must be updated by the addon developer to support the
newer SDK v2.

Page 362 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Construct will warn you if you open a project that uses SDK v1 addons. If you see such a
warning, consider the following options to resolve it:
Addons installed from the official Addons website should auto-update to the latest version. If
you see a prompt about addon updates being available on startup, click the notification and
update addons with the Addon Manager. If the addon developer has published an update
using SDK v2, this will then update the addon to that version.
If the addon was not installed from the official addons website, check with the addon
developer to see if an update is available, and manually download and install the updated
addon.
If there is no update for the addon using SDK v2, contact the addon developer and ask them
to provide an update.
Consider replacing the addons with other features. For example if your project uses a thirdparty addon for tweening, it may be possible to use the built-in Tween behavior instead.
Alternatively a different third-party addon may be available that uses SDK v2. It may even be
the case that you can just remove the addon if it turns out it is not really necessary.
The SDK v2 was first made available to addon developers in May 2024. SDK v1 addons will
continue to be supported in Construct via an LTS release up to the end of 2026, which should
provide plenty of time for addon developers to update their addons, or for existing projects to
either be updated or completed.

Export file structure 'Flat' mode
Historically Construct exported projects with all project files in the root folder and with
lowercased filenames, referred to as flat mode. In 2022 Construct was updated to preserve the
folder structure and filename case of project files, referred to as folders mode. This is a much
better mode as it preserves your folder organisation and is important for features like JavaScript
Modules. However changing the mode could break some projects, as it changes where some
project files are found, such as when requesting project files by URL.
For example consider a project using a file named "Hello.txt" in a subfolder named "myfolder".
The file path is in fact "myfolder/Hello.txt". However in flat mode, where project files are referred
to by a string, this file could be loaded from the path "hello.txt", as it exports all files in the root
folder with lowercased names. After changing to folders mode, the file must be referred to with
the string "myfolder/Hello.txt", reflecting its true path; the old string will no longer refer to the file
and may return an error such as 404 Not Found. This also applies to audio files referred to by a
string, although the file extension is omitted for those.
To change a project using the legacy flat mode to use the modern folders mode, follow these
steps.
1

Select the project name in the Project Bar to show project properties.

2

In the Properties Bar, scroll down to the Compatibility settings section, and expand it if
necessary.

Construct 3 Official Manual

3

Change the Export file structure property to Folders.

4

Update the project to fix any changed file references, as described above.

Cordova iOS/Android scheme
In the past mobile exports internally ran on the file: scheme, much like opening a local HTML file
on your computer in your browser. This mode is inefficient, has limited capabilities, and is
extremely difficult to support due to severe technical restrictions on the limited features
available with the file: scheme.
In 2020 Construct added support for the app: scheme for iOS, and in 2021 the https: scheme for
Android. These modes work almost identically to the way a real HTTP server does, and are much
more efficient, more capable, and easier to support.
Due to the technical complexity of continuing to support them, support for the legacy file: modes
will be removed in future. Where possible projects should all switch over to the new app: or https:
schemes.
Warning: changing this setting will have the effect of clearing storage, as it changes the URL
used internally to load the project, and storage is remembered based on the URL. Therefore
you should not change this setting if you've already published a mobile app which uses
storage. If you still need to maintain an already-published mobile project using the legacy
file: scheme, you will have to stay on an old version of Construct once the mode has been
removed to continue updating the app while preserving storage.
If your project has not been published to mobile - including if you do something like provide a
template project that you distribute to others - or if your app does not make use of storage, then
you should make sure the iOS and Android schemes are app: and https:.
To change a project using the legacy file schemes to use the modern modes, follow these steps.
1

Select the project name in the Project Bar to show project properties.

2

In the Properties Bar, scroll down to the Compatibility settings section, and expand it if
necessary.

3

Change the Cordova iOS scheme property to Modern (app:).

4

Change the Cordova Android scheme property to Modern (https:).

NW.js exporter
For many years Construct used a framework called NW.js for its desktop exports, along with an
NW.js plugin for further integration. Modern versions of Construct have switched over to
separate Windows, macOS and Linux exporters using different technologies. The NW.js exporter
continues to be provided for backwards-compatibility reasons only - new projects should avoid
using it, and where possible consider moving existing projects off it as well.

Construct 3 Official Manual

Deprecated plugins/behaviors
Construct will list any plugins or behaviors used in your project that are marked deprecated. This
means the entire plugin or behavior is no longer supported and should not be used any more.
Usually this is because it has been replaced by a newer addon or feature, or the addon was for a
third-party service that was shut down. If your project uses deprecated addons, you should
delete them from your project, and where applicable replace them with a newer addon or
different feature.
To remove a deprecated plugin, all object types based on the plugin must be deleted from the
Project Bar. To remove a deprecated behavior, all objects using the behavior must have the
behavior removed.
To help you identify where a deprecated addon is used, follow these steps.
1

Right-click the name of the project in the Project Bar.

2

Choose Tools►View used addons.

3

Find the deprecated addon in the list.

4

In the References column, the first few object names using the plugin or behavior are listed. To
see a comprehensive list, right-click on the addon and choose Find all references....

Deprecated plugins and behaviors are hidden from the list when adding a new object or behavior.
Therefore any plugins or behaviors you can still add from Construct are not deprecated. Any of
these can be used as replacements for deprecated addons.

Functions
The legacy Function plugin will also be listed as a deprecated plugin. In 2019, Construct 3
introduced a new built-in functions feature which replaces the old Function plugin. Projects using
legacy Functions should switch to using the new built-in system.
To help with converting to built-in functions, you can right-click an On function condition in the
old Function plugin, and select Replace with built-in function. Note due to differences between
the features, it may not always be possible to automatically replace the function, and you will
need to do it manually instead.
For more information on built-in functions, see the manual section on Functions.

Classic scripts
Construct's JavaScript coding feature relies on JavaScript Modules, using import and export
statements. However it originally used "classic" mode scripts, which don't support import or
export statements. In 2020 Construct added support for modules, and in 2021 it removed
support for the legacy "classic" mode scripts. To help you identify compatibility problems with
old projects, Construct continues to warn you if you open a project that was still using "classic"
mode scripts.

Page 365 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

To update the project to use modules, refer to the tutorial Upgrading projects from classic
scripts to modules. The next time you save the project the deprecation warning will no longer
appear.

Other deprecated features
Sometimes individual conditions, actions or expressions are marked deprecated, or effects are
deprecated. Construct does not currently notify you about these, because they are generally
minor and easy to continue to support in the long term. However you may notice these as some
conditions, actions, expressions or effects that you can access from the user interface differ
from the ones referenced in an old project. If this is annoying for any reason, you can delete the
old usage and add it back with the new usage to update it, but usually this is not necessary to
keep the project working.

IMPORTING CONSTRUCT 2
PROJECTS
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/tips-and-guides/importing-c2projects

Construct 3 is largely backwards-compatible with Construct 2. You can usually import Construct
2 projects in to Construct 3 and it will open them so you can continue working on them in
Construct 3. One easy way to do this is to drag-and-drop a Construct 2 .capx file in to the
Construct 3 window. However sometimes you will need to make changes to an imported
Construct 2 project to continue developing it in Construct 3.
Note that Construct 3 saves projects in a different format to Construct 2. While C3 can open
C2 projects, C2 can't open C3 projects. Make sure you are ready to move entirely to
Construct 3 before making significant changes to an imported Construct 2 project.
This guide covers some points to be aware of when importing Construct 2 projects to Construct
3.
Construct 2 was retired in July 2021 and is no longer officially supported. For more
information see the blog post Sunsetting Construct 2. However you can still import your C2
projects in to C3.

Replaced features
Construct 3 originally inherited all of Construct 2's features. Over the years some key features
have been replaced and the old feature retired. These include:
The entire runtime was rewritten and upgraded to an enhanced, modernized and faster
engine, referred to as the C3 runtime. This is highly compatible with the old runtime but there
are some compatibility differences.
The Function plugin has been replaced with a built-in functions feature
Construct 3 now exports projects with a proper "folder" file structure, preserving subfolders
and filename case, instead of the legacy "flat" mode which exported everything in the root
folder with a lowercased name.
You may need to update an imported C2 project to take in to account these changes. For more
information, see the deprecated features section. The rest of this guide also includes details
about other compatibility differences.

Page 367 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Compatibility differences
This section covers some changes made either with Construct 3 or its new runtime that may
affect how imported Construct 2 projects work.

Setting effect color parameters
In Construct 2, some effects like Tint and Set color specified a color parameter as three separate
parameters for the red, green and blue components. In Construct 3, these parameters have been
replaced by a single color parameter. Construct 3 will show a color picker instead of three
number fields for red, green and blue.
Construct 3 should correctly import the right color value. However if you use Set effect
parameter in your events to change the effect's color, this will need updating. Previously you may
have used actions like:
Set effect "Tint" parameter 0 to redAmount
Set effect "Tint" parameter 1 to greenAmount
Set effect "Tint" parameter 2 to blueAmount
In Construct 3 there is now only one parameter instead of three. So this action needs to be
replaced by:
Set effect "Tint" parameter 0 to rgbEx(redAmount, greenAmount, blueAmount)

Physics behavior stepping mode
In Construct 2, the Physics behavior defaulted to fixed stepping mode. This meant simulations
were deterministic, but also meant it assumed a fixed display rate of 60 Hz. This was a
reasonable assumption in the early 2010s, but now devices with varying refresh rates are much
more common, such as phones with 90 Hz displays, tablets with 120 Hz displays, and gaming
monitors with 144Hz+ displays. On these devices the fixed framerate mode of the Physics
behavior appears to run in fast-forward mode.
To avoid this, the Physics behavior in Construct 3 instead defaults to framerate independent
mode. This ensures it works at the same speed on all displays, but means the simulation is no
longer deterministic. If you want to restore a deterministic simulation you can use the Set
stepping mode action to switch back to Fixed mode - but then note you will have the
aforementioned problem of the gameplay running too fast on high refresh rate displays.

Dynamically creating objects
In the C2 runtime, creating an object which is not placed on the layout (and so is not loaded in to
memory) immediately loads images for the object, which can "jank" the game (cause a short
pause while loading is done). In the C3 runtime, in this case the game continues to run and the
images are loaded in parallel. This provides better loading performance and avoids janking the
game. However the object can exist for a short period of time while the images are still being

Page 368 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

loaded. During this time the object is not drawn, as if it were set to invisible. In some cases this
can cause a noticable flicker, especially if the object is intended to cover up something else. The
workaround is to place the object in the layout, and destroy it in On start of layout if it is not
needed. This ensures Construct loads its images when loading the layout, avoiding any delay
when creating it.

System object changes
The following changes were made to the System object, and system expressions, in the C3
runtime:
The WindowWidth and WindowHeight expressions have been removed. These were
confusingly named, but if you need the same values, use the Platform Info object's
CanvasDeviceWidth and CanvasDeviceHeight expressions. Usually it's better to use the new
ViewportWidth and ViewportHeight system expressions instead, which return a size in layout
pixels rather than device (physical display) pixels.
The Is on mobile and Is on platform conditions have been moved to the Platform Info object.
The Renderer and RendererDetail expressions have been moved to the Platform Info object.
The rgb expression has been removed. Instead use the new rgbEx or rgba expressions. Note
rgb used values in the 0-255 range, but rgbEx and rgba use values in the 0-100 range, and
also support a wider range with better precision.

User Media object changes
In the C3 runtime, the User Media object's speech synthesis, speech recognition, and canvas
recording features have been moved to separate plugins (Speech Synthesis, Speech Recognition
and Video recorder). Existing projects using these User Media features can be used in C3, but
those features will no longer work until you replace them with the new plugins.
Also note that the Snapshot action no longer provides the snapshot immediately: you must use
the On snapshot ready trigger to know when SnapshotURL is available.

Browser object changes
The following changes have been made for the Browser object in the C3 runtime:
The battery features have been removed due to lack of browser support.
The network information and various display related expressions have been moved to the
Platform Info object.
On suspended and On resumed have been moved to the System object. The Page is visible
condition has been replaced with the Is suspended system condition (which makes the
inverse check).

Third-party addons

Page 369 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

If your project uses third-party plugins, behaviors or effects, these need to be available in
Construct 3 as well before you can import a Construct 2 project using them. Note that Construct
2 addon files (.c2addon) cannot be used in Construct 3. The addon needs to be updated to work
with Construct 3, and distributed as a Construct 3 addon file (.c3addon).
Note that third-party addon developers are independent of Scirra and we cannot provide support
for their addons. If you need help with third-party addons you'll need to contact the addon
developer.

BEHAVIOR REFERENCE
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/behavior-reference

This section provides a reference of all the official behaviors that come with Construct. Each has
an overview of its use, a list of its properties, and a detailed list of the actions, conditions and
expressions specific to that behavior. Behaviors add their actions, conditions and expressions to
the object they are added to, appearing alongside the object's own features in the Add
condition/action dialog and Expressions dictionary.
Behaviors can be added and removed from objects via the Properties Bar.

Custom controls
By default, user-controlled movement behaviors use a standard set of controls (usually based
around the arrow keys). To change these, disable the Default controls property, and set up some
events using the Simulate control action. The following events show how to use the W, A and D
keys to control the Platform movement.

Note that the input events must be continually true, i.e. using Key is down and not On key
pressed.
The Simulate control action does not have to be used with keyboard input. For example, it can be
used with touch input to create on-screen touch controls, or with Gamepad input. Alternatively,
you can set up events to automatically control objects with the Simulate control action. This
allows you to set up computer-controlled enemies or non-player characters (NPCs), sometimes
loosely referred to as "AI".

Construct 3 Official Manual

8 DIRECTION BEHAVIOR
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/behavior-reference/8-direction

The 8 Direction behavior allows an object to be moved up, down, left, right and on diagonals,
controlled by the arrow keys by default. It is often useful for controlling the player in a top-down
view game. It can also be set to 4 directions or simple up/down or left/right movement which is
useful for paddles or sliders. Click here to open an example of the 8-direction behavior.
The 8 Direction behavior is blocked by any objects with the Solid behavior.
To set up custom or automatic controls, see the behavior reference summary.

Scripting
When using JavaScript or TypeScript coding, the features of this behavior can be accessed via
the I8DirectionBehaviorInstance script interface.

8 Direction properties
Max speed

The maximum speed the object can travel at in any direction, in pixels per second.
Acceleration

The rate the movement accelerates at, in pixels per second per second. When reversing
against the current movement, acceleration and deceleration both contribute to slowing
down.
Deceleration

The rate the movement decelerates to rest when not being moved, in pixels per second per
second. When reversing against the current movement, acceleration and deceleration both
contribute to slowing down.
Directions

Set how many directions the movement can move in. By default it is 8 Directions, allowing
movement on diagonals. 4 directions prevents movement on diagonals, and Up & down or
Left & right only allows movement along a single axis.
Set angle

Page 372 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Whether or not the movement should also affect the objects angle. 360 degree (smooth) will
always set the object's angle to the current angle of motion. 45-degree intervals will set the
object's angle to 8 possible directions. 90-degree intervals will set the object's angle to 4
possible directions. No means the behavior will not set the object's angle at all, which is
useful if you want to control this yourself with events (e.g. to make the object point towards
the mouse cursor).
Allow sliding

If disabled, the object will simply stop when it collides with a solid. If enabled, the object will
be able to continue moving along angled solids when it collides with them, essentially
'slipping' or 'sliding' along them.
Default controls

If enabled, movement is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard. Disable to set up
custom controls using the Simulate control action. For more information see the behavior
reference summary.
Enabled

Whether the behavior is initially enabled or disabled. If disabled, it can be enabled at runtime
using the Set enabled action.

8 Direction conditions
Allows sliding

Test if the behavior currently allows sliding along solids.
Compare speed

Compare the object's current speed in pixels per second.
Is enabled

Test if the behavior is currently enabled. When disabled it will have no effect on the object.
Is moving

True if the object has a non-zero speed (is not stopped). Invert to test if the object is
stopped.

8 Direction actions
Reverse

Page 373 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Invert the direction of motion. Useful as a simple way to bounce the object off an obstacle.
Set acceleration
Set deceleration
Set allow sliding
Set max speed
Set default controls

These set the corresponding properties, described under 8 Direction properties.
Set enabled

Enable or disable the movement. If disabled, the movement no longer has any effect on the
object.
Set ignoring input

Set whether input is being ignored. If input is ignored, pressing any of the control keys has no
effect. However, unlike disabling the behavior, the object can continue to move.
Set speed

Set the current speed the object is moving at, in pixels per second.
Set vector X
Set vector Y

Set the X and Y components of the movement, in pixels per second.
Simulate control

Simulate one of the movement controls being held down. Useful when Default controls is
disabled. See the behavior reference summary for more information.
Stop

A shortcut for setting the speed to zero.

8 Direction expressions
Acceleration
Deceleration
MaxSpeed

Page 374 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Return the corresponding properties, described under 8 Direction properties.
MovingAngle

Get the current angle of motion (which can be different to the object's angle), in degrees.
Speed

Get the current object's movement speed, in pixels per second.
VectorX
VectorY

Get the object's current speed on each axis, in pixels per second. For example, if the object is
moving to the left at 100 pixels per second, VectorX is -100 and VectorY is 0.

Construct 3 Official Manual

ANCHOR BEHAVIOR
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/behavior-reference/anchor

The Anchor behavior is useful for automatically positioning objects relative to the viewport. This
is useful for supporting multiple screen sizes.
Objects using the Anchor behavior should also be placed on a layer with its parallax set to 0% x
0%. Otherwise as the game scrolls the objects may "lag" behind the screen.

Scripting
When using JavaScript or TypeScript coding, the features of this behavior can be accessed via
the IAnchorBehaviorInstance script interface.

Positioning objects relative to the viewport
In the top-left of the Layout View, a dotted outline represents the viewport. Anchored objects
should be positioned inside the dotted viewport area, as shown below.

Positioning anchored objects in the layout

Now if the window is resized during preview, the objects maintain their relative positions, as
shown below. Note this demo uses Scale outer fullscreen mode to allow the aspect ratio to
change.

Page 376 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

Anchored objects in preview

This is useful for interface elements like notifications and heads-up displays (HUDs).

Relative positioning
The Left edge and Top edge position the object relative to the viewport edges, without changing
the object size. For example, if the Left edge is set to Viewport right, the object will always stay
the same distance from the right edge of the viewport.
The Right edge and Bottom edge resize the object relative to the viewport edges. For example, if
you want a Tiled Background to stretch wider as the window widens, set Right edge to Viewport
right.

Anchor conditions
Is enabled

Test if the behavior is currently enabled. When disabled it will have no effect on the object.

Anchor actions
Set enabled

Set whether the behavior is enabled or disabled. If disabled, the behavior will not alter the
size or position of the object.

Anchor expressions
The Anchor behavior has no expressions.

BOUND TO LAYOUT BEHAVIOR
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/behavior-reference/bound-tolayout

The Bound to Layout behavior simply prevents an object leaving the edge of the layout. It is
most useful on objects which move around but should not leave the layout area.
It has no conditions, actions or expressions, just the following property:
Bound by
Set to Edge to prevent any part of the object leaving the layout. The object will stop at the
position shown below:

Set to Origin to only prevent the object's origin leaving the layout. The result depends on where
the origin is placed on the object, but with a centred origin the object will stop in a position
similar to the image shown below:

Page 378 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

BULLET BEHAVIOR
View online: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/construct-3/behavior-reference/bullet

The Bullet behavior simply moves an object forwards at an angle. However, it provides extra
options like gravity and bouncing that allow it to also be used like a bouncing ball. Like the name
suggests it is ideal for projectiles like bullets, but it is also useful for automatically controlling
other types of objects like enemies which move forwards continuously.
For two examples of the Bullet behavior see the Bouncing balls and Bouncing bullets examples
in the Example Browser.

Scripting
When using JavaScript or TypeScript coding, the features of this behavior can be accessed via
the IBulletBehaviorInstance script interface.

Stepping bullets
Normally the bullet behavior moves a fixed distance every tick. However if it is moving extremely
fast, the distance it moves in one frame can be enough to jump over obstacles in their entirety.
To avoid this problem you can enable the Step property. This will move the object in small
increments, triggering On step each time. In On step you can add an Is overlapping condition to
check if the bullet is overlapping an obstacle with improved accuracy.
In an On step event the Stop stepping action will prevent the bullet advancing any further. This
leaves the bullet in the first position it collided with an object, which is a good place to create an
effect like an explosion. You can also Destroy the object which will also automatically stop
stepping.
For an example of how stepping works, see the Bullet stepping example in the Example Browser.
While the same technique can also be used to make instant hit bullets, this is usually better done
using the raycasting feature of the Line of Sight behavior, as demonstrated in the Instant hit laser
example.

Bullet properties
Speed

The bullet's initial speed, in pixels per second.
Acceleration

Page 379 of 1146

Construct 3 Official Manual

The rate of acceleration for the bullet, in pixels per second per second. Zero will keep a
constant speed, positive values accelerate, and negative values decelerate until a stop (the
object will not go in to reverse).
Gravity

The force of gravity, which causes acceleration downwards, in pixels per second per second.
Zero disables gravity which is useful for top-down games. Positive values cause a parabolic
path as the bullet is bullet down by gravity.
Bounce off solids
